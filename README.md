# First_Challenge
My first bootcamp coding challenge. YaaaY!


For this challenge I was given a code.

This challenge dealt with UX more than anything

I had to make sure all the element titles had a purpose.

I had to make sure the images had alt titles

I had to make sure the title was accurate and not vague

I had to makes sure there wasn't a crossover betweeen structure and stylin gand if so correct it.

I had to make sure the heading were labled in correct order
